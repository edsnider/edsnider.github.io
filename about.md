I am Ed Snider — a developer, speaker, author, and [Xamarin MVP](http://www.xamarin.com/mvp){:target="_blank"} based in the Washington D.C. / Northern Virginia area.  I have a passion for mobile design and development and regularly speak about [Xamarin](http://www.xamarin.com){:target="_blank"} and Windows app development throughout the local developer community in the D.C./Maryland/Virginia area.  I also run the [D.C. Mobile .NET Developers Group](http://www.meetup.com/dcmobiledev){:target="_blank"} ([@dcmobiledev](http://www.twitter.com/dcmobiledev){:target="_blank"}) which focuses on bringing local developers together to talk and learn about mobile development with .NET and Xamarin.

I work at [InfernoRed Technology](http://www.infernored.com){:target="_blank"} ([@infernoredtech](http://www.twitter.com/infernoredtech){:target="_blank"}).  At InfernoRed I am primarily focused on working with clients and partners to build awesome mobile solutions on the Windows, iOS and Android platforms.

I’ve been coding for over half my life (since I was 15).  I got my first job in 1999 working at a Piedmont Press and Graphics maintaining the local newspaper’s website.  For the first few years of my career I worked with Cold Fusion to develop dynamic web applications and e-commerce solutions.  I started working with the .NET framework right when .NET 2.0 was coming out and have pretty much been doing .NET development ever since – starting with WinForms and ASP.NET and then getting into SharePoint solution development and now of course mobile apps.

I wrote a book about developing mobile apps with [Xamarin.Forms](http://www.xamarin.com/forms){:target="_blank"}.  The book is titled **“Mastering Xamarin.Forms”** and is available on Amazon at [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1785287192](){:target="_blank"}.
